After initial exchange of info about family, work... he concluded that I'am the only one who started its own business from a whole group of students who enrolled studies that year. In total it was more than 100 people.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised by the fact, I never thought about it that way, is ti possible that only 1% or less of graduated students starts their own business...? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked some statistics online and found this: "data shows that 4.7% of recent graduates are self-employed or freelance, with only 0.6% having actually started their own business. This compares with 8.7% of the general population who have started a business in the last three years."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a problem there: a lot of time and money invested in their education, and after all that working on a business idea may require long hours and initial low pay, fear of failing and what others will say, or something else...?  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>2019-12-09</title><link href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/microblog/2019-12-09.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ilija</name></author><id>tag:127.0.0.1,2019-12-09:/microblog/2019-12-09.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Frequently bought together" src="/images/microblog/iphone-toilet-board.png" title="Frequently bought together"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Frequently bought together" src="/images/microblog/iphone-toilet-board.png" title="Frequently bought together"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>2019-12-04</title><link href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/microblog/2019-12-04.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-12-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Ilija</name></author><id>tag:127.0.0.1,2019-12-04:/microblog/2019-12-04.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My 2 cents on innovations:&lt;/p&gt;
