&lt;p&gt;By halfway through the book I was thinking of giving up reading and then suddenly the book became a well-directed thriller. Attacks, threats and blackmail to cover up the biggest fraud in the history of the startup world.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Brotopia</title><link href="http://questforconsciousness.org/books/brotopia.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Ilija</name></author><id>tag:questforconsciousness.org,2019-10-07:/books/brotopia.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review - Brotopia by Emily Chang&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The book begins with the topic of gender inequality in the IT industry and how it came about throughout history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you thought the startup movement was the most exalted thing the human race has produced, you were fooled. Sexual extortion and harassment, gender discrimination in a word "the modern wild west". Only mens and girls who accepted the rules of the game have access to the club.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Data smart</title><link href="http://questforconsciousness.org/books/data-smart.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-07T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2019-10-07T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Ilija</name></author><id>tag:questforconsciousness.org,2019-10-07:/books/data-smart.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Book review - Data smart by John W.

&lt;p&gt;You do not need to complete an advanced data science course to use popular statistical methods and algorithms.

&lt;p&gt;Two things impressed me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His dedication to business details and his willingness to learn so he can make the right decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That before he went into business with SpaceX and SolarCity, he had no idea about those industries, other than a childhood dream of traveling to Mars sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent Van Gogh was actually a "bad" painter, he didn't sell any paintings for life. 
What made him famous happened afterwards. 
Over 600 letters that he exchanged with his brother were published as a book by his 
brother's wife, Johanna. 
The book is probably one of the first successful marketing campaigns and one of the first 
successful examples of storytelling. The connections between Vincent's tragic life 
described in the book and his paintings made him one of the greatest painters of all time.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
